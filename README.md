# Rust Cohort Assignment Repository

## Overview
This repository contains my submissions for the Rust programming cohort assignments. The code is organized into subfolders, each representing a different assignment or module of the course.

## Structure
```
/
├── assignment_ONE/          # First assignment solution
├── assignment_TWO/          # Second assignment solution
├── assignment_THREE/          # Third assignment solution
├── ...                    # Additional assignments
└── README.md              # This file
```

## Getting Started

To work with any of the assignments:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific assignment folder:
   ```bash
   cd assignment_X  # Replace X with the assignment number
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the assignment's specific README (if available) or examine the code directly.

## Requirements
- Rust toolchain (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- Cargo (comes with Rust installation)

## Building and Running

For each assignment:
1. Change to the assignment directory:
   ```bash
   cd assignment_X
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```
3. Run the project:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## Notes
- Some assignments may have additional dependencies or specific instructions - check individual assignment folders for details.
- All code was tested with Rust version 1.85.0 (stable).
